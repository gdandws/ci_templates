ci_templates
============

ci_templates is a Code Igniter project that I'm starting using Code Igniter 2.2.0 and wiredesignz HVMC plugin. 

I will be taking free and open source bootstrap template breaking them up in to components for a quick and simple template set up and also allowing for a simple system for switching templates. This templating system is part of a big project that I will be posting soon for a VPS Web Hosting Control Panel that will allow for quick and easy installations of Codeigniter, Laravel and Wordpress. 

I will also be creating a templating system with laravel as well...

I will not be doing much with wordpress as of now. I will only be including wordpress because of it's popularity.

If there are any developer out the who are willing to join this project, please shoot me an eamil at betteryourweb@gmail.com.
